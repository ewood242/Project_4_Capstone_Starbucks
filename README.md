**Libraries & Installation**

This project uses Python version 3.* and the following libraries:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
datetime
sklearn

**Project Motivation**

This project was the final of four in the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program. 

The goal of this project was to use simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app to gain an understanding of how customers interact with offers and which offers they are more likely to respond to. 

**Repository Files**

The Jupiter Notebook File titled "Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb" contains all relevant data processing, analysis, and modeling used to write the corresponding blog post.

This project utilizes simulated Stabucks rewards mobile app data. The data set consists of three json files contained within the data folder:

portfolio.json - This file contains 6 columns ('reward', 'channels', 'difficulty', 'duration', 'offer_type', and 'id') and 10 rows of data pertaining to the offers sent to the app users.
profile.json - This file contains 5 columns ('gender', 'age', 'id', 'became_member_on', 'income') and 17,000 rows of data pertaining to each mobile app user.
transcript.json - This file contains 4 columns ('person', 'event', 'value', and 'time') and 306,534 rows of data pertaining to each user event ('transaction', 'offer received', 'offer viewed', and 'offer completed').

**Conclusion**
